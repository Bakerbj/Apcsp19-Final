    <u> <h1 class = "title" id = "first">Random Story Generator</h1> </u> 
    <p class = "mission">Our mission here at ebbuvkeau4owaiun industries is to prevent both 
         boredom and writer's block. By giving a completely random story, we will 
         inspire readers to create their own stories, and with a litte work, they may
         even become almost as good of writers as this computer. Maybe.
    </p>
    <p class = "mission">This website was created by a nonwriter for literally
         anybody to read.</p>
    <p class = "mission">This website is here to achieve multiple purposes. The first
         two of course are to prevent boredom, useful in keeping people from doing stupid
         things for entertainment, and to prevent writers block, by giving creative directions
         for authors to take their stories into. In addition, this website promotes reading,
         which is far too uncommon in today's society. By providing humorous situations,
         users will develop good feelings about reading, and want to read more often.
